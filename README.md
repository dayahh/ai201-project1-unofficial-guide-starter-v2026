# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**
**Overlap:**

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks
======================================================================
Chunk 1  |  source: guide_accessibility.md#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.

======================================================================
Chunk 2  |  source: guide_corry_vale.md#7  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
There is a farm shop at the valley mouth that sells bread, cheese and little else, and it closes at 4pm. Bring supplies; this is not a place with options.

======================================================================
Chunk 3  |  source: guide_givens_mill.md#3  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Everything is on one street along the river. The mill is at one end and the church at the other, eight minutes apart.

======================================================================
Chunk 4  |  source: guide_kestrelford.md#15  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
The nearest full hospital is in Brightwater; there is
a minor injuries unit locally with limited hours.

======================================================================
Chunk 5  |  source: guide_regional_transport.md#8  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Parking is the constraint rather than driving. Both Halden Bay lots fill by
10am on summer weekends.

Gate: best distance 0.429 is under the 0.6 cutoff

```
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

     I have decided to use 0.5 as my relevance cutoff. I'm using this number because most distances for each response to my questions had better results at the 0.4 or 0.5 mark and I want to keep that number as low as possible. For my questions that I came up with, these answers were easily found in the documentation, so their numbers ran low like 0.3 or 0.5 distance wise. For the questions that were out of scope, their numbers were very high like 0.7 or 0.9. The gap came when questions were out of scope so the distances were all higher than an in scope question.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| What do students say about good places to eat Outside Marchwood? | Yes | 0.456 |
| When does Brightwater's Tuesday market close? | Yes | 0.394 |
| Is Halden Bay's seafood fresh? | Yes | 0.396 |
| What does Corry Vale sell | Yes | 0.476 |
| Is Kestrelford good to walk in snow | Yes | 0.429 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.887 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.897 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.903 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.829 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.853 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
